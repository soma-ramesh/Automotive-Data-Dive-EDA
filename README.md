# Automotive-Data-Dive-EDA
-----------------
The purpose of this project is to master the exploratory data analysis (EDA) in diverse Cars dataset with Pandas framework.
------------------
## Overview:
Welcome to Automotive Data Dive EDA, a project where I explored and analyzed a diverse Cars dataset to gain insights into the factors influencing car prices. This project is a part of my Data Analyst internship at Unified Mentor Pvt. Ltd.

## Project Highlights:
- **Data Exploration Mastery:** Conducted a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python, focusing on cleaning, feature engineering, and outlier removal.
- **Visual Storytelling:** Employed various visualizations, including histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps, to communicate complex patterns and relationships within the dataset.
- **Predictive Analytics Foundation:** Positioned the project for future predictive modeling by identifying key features impacting car prices.

## Steps Involved
1. **Data Preparation:**
   - Loaded the dataset into a dataframe.
   - Observed and checked data types for each feature.
   - Dropped irrelevant columns and renamed the remaining ones.

2. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Removed duplicate rows and null values.
   - Applied the IQR method to identify and remove outliers.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis:**
   - Visualized univariate distributions using histograms, density plots, and bar charts.
   - Explored bivariate distributions through scatter plots, Violin plot.
   - Conducted multivariate analysis using heatmaps.

   
## Used Libraries:
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Next Steps
- This project lays the foundation for future predictive analytics endeavors. The identified patterns and relationships can guide further modeling and forecasting.
